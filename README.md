ALK Web Site Source Code
========================

Welcome to the source code of the ALK Web Site. This is made to be usable again, though it probably hard to use for now. That documentation will be edited over time (maybe).


Installation
---------------
Download, upload, console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql then --force. Maybe it will work. More info to come.

What's inside?
---------------
The Symfony Standard Edition + modified Bootstrap (yes, it was the bad way to do it, need to fix it) + Ckeditor + Mercury editor (not used) + my bundle. So check out their README, please.
